# Week-9-readme-generator

## DESCRIPTION
This PROJECT was created using node.js to generate a professional README.md from the command line. It's  aim is to cut down on the amount of time developers spend using to write their README.md files. Using inquirer (node package manager) this application takes the user through a series of prompts, asking them their name, title of their application, application description, installation instructions, usage information, instructions, what type of license they want their application to be covered under, as well as their GitHub handle, and email. Once all of the prompts are answered, the application will then generate a professional README file with the information the user input. 

## USAGE 
The application is simple to use. The user will just have to follow the promts given on the terminal and answer the questions related to their project as well as inputting their github username and email address. They will then be presented with a professional read me file.
Below I have included a link of the video of how the application works
